UNUSED

“Construction or demolition, I don’t know yet,” (268). 

The Schrella siblings, gods emissary of light, and an angel of darkness. both have direct access to the shepherd, both are his friends and advisors. both are good?

If the host of the beast is evil/violent, and the host of the lamb is good/pacifist, what is the shepherd. Someone who looks after the lamb, but is not one of them, and someone who fights the beast. NOT pacifist. Is Boll saying that violence is justified?

Heinrich the creator, the establisher, the patriarch, the builder
Robert the destroyer, the demolisher, the resistor, the rebel, the shepherd??
Joseph the future, the unknown, the decider, 

PROMPT
Another significant theme in this novel is generations. Three generations of architects are depicted here. To what extent is each of these characters reflective of the time that person came of age? How has the near-continuous presence of war inflected what might otherwise have been a normal family dynamic among these three?

GUIDELINES
(1) Your paper should be double-spaced and written in a 12-point font. 
(2) At a minimum, your paper should run 1,500 words (with most fonts, that’s around five or six pages). Please do not exceed eight pages. 
(3) Because you are relying upon a single author, there is no need for you to introduce footnotes or a bibliography. On those occasions when you are quoting Böll’s words directly, or referring in great detail to a specific passage, a simple page number in parentheses will do (203). If you draw upon other authors, in-text citations (Böll, 324) are adequate. 
(4) Be sure to use formal English. Write in complete sentences; use punctuation appropriately; and be sure to spell-check your document!
